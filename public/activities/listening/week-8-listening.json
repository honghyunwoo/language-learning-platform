    "text": "Hey Emily, did you see the new movie that was released last week?\n\nYes! I watched it on Saturday. It's the film that everyone is talking about.\n\nWhat did you think? I heard it was directed by Christopher Nolan.\n\nThat's right. It was directed by him, and I must say it was brilliantly made. The story, which was written by his brother, was really complex but fascinating.\n\nI've heard the special effects were amazing too.\n\nAbsolutely! The effects, which were created by a team in London, were incredible. Some scenes were filmed in real locations, which made everything feel more authentic.\n\nInteresting! Have you read the book that the movie was based on?\n\nNo, I haven't. But my friend Sarah, whose opinion I really trust, said the book is even better than the movie.\n\nReally? Who was it written by?\n\nIt was written by a British author whose name is Ian McEwan. He's someone who has won many awards for his novels.\n\nI should read it then. Is it the kind of book that can be read quickly?\n\nNot really. It's quite long and the language that is used is quite sophisticated. But the characters who are described in the book are very interesting.\n\nSounds good. I'll definitely check it out. By the way, have you heard about the new series that's been released on Netflix?\n\nYes! It's the one that was recommended by all the critics, right? It's supposed to be amazing.\n\nExactly. It was produced by the same people who made that award-winning documentary last year.\n\nOh, the documentary that was shown at the film festival? I loved that one!\n\nYes, that's the one. They're really talented filmmakers whose work is always impressive.",
