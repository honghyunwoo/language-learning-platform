At the top of the mountain, we ate our packed lunch and enjoyed the amazing view.\n\nIn the afternoon, we visited a small village near the mountains. The people there were very friendly. We bought some fresh vegetables and fruits from a local market.\n\nOn Sunday morning, we went fishing at a lake. My brother caught three fish! We cooked the fish for lunch and they were delicious.\n\nWe came back home on Sunday evening. Everyone was tired but happy. It was one of the best weekends ever!",
